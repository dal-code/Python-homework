This repository contains coding questions to grasp basic language skills of python. each question is presented along with a py file, which provides the structure of the code for
the question. the name of the py file, and the function prototypes in the py file should not be modified in any circumstances. You should only add code to implement the functional 
specified in the question description. Of course, you can add code in the if __name__=='__main__' block to test your implementation, but this part is ignored when the py file is 
submitted. After the question is solved, the py file containing your implementation should be submitted, for example, if a question provides a StarTriangle.py file, the same py 
file with your written code should be submitted.
